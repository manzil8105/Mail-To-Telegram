The purpose of this python script is to check your email inbox and send you notifications on telegram about unread emails.
I personally sometimes forget to check my mail notifications, and sometimes I don’t check because of all the clutter of newsletters and stuff.
As a consequence, sometimes I miss vital emails. But I never miss telegram notifications. So this “mail to telegram” system was made.
